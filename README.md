# International Language files for X4B.Net static pages

Want to see your language supported for error & challenge pages? Language files contributed to this repository will be reviewed for acceptance. 

We'd welcome any contribution! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles. You will be required to sign the CLA in your PR request. You can find detail on [the CLA here](https://github.com/X4BNet/static-page-i8n/blob/main/CLA.md)

## Language Files

Languages files are json documents with ISO 639-1 country codes in key value formats. Only the value of the key needs to be translated (key name, html and template tags should remain as-is).

Language updates will be reviewed before inclusion.
